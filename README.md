# Booster

## Summary

Booster is a test generation tool that generates a new test suite by reusing existing inputs from the initial test suite. Orthogonal to existing approaches, Booster does not generate new inputs but instead aims to generate a new test suite that enhances bug detection capabilities.

*Boooster is still a prototype, and we will continue to optimize and improve this system.*

## Usage

Booster is easy to use.
You only need to get into the Booster directory and execute [executable](./Booster/Booster-shadow.jar) in the Java 1.8 environment.
[README.md](./Booster/README.md) is a detailed usage instruction.

## Experiment Results

To evaluate the effectiveness of Booster, we conduct experiments on the 833 bugs in Defects4J. We apply Booster to the initial test suites generated by Randoop and EvoSuite, generating new test suites. These generated test suites are then executed on both the buggy and fixed versions to observe different behaviors and evaluate bug detection. 
As a result, Booster demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in bug detection compared to the initial test suites and showed better efficiency than existing test generation tools within the same test generation time budget. Detailed experimental results can be found in [README.md](./dataset/).
